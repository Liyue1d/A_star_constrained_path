# A_star_constrained_path

Uses an A* domain to compute the solutions in a graph to problems instances \n I = (s,d,M) where:
s: start node
d: end node
M: list of mandatory nodes to visit at least once

Requirements:
- numpy
- networkx
- scipy

Instructions:
- Place the graph in the input folder
- Execute run.py at the root
